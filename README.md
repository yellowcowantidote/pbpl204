# Employment Centers in Southern California

This project examines regional employment centers in San Diego and Riverside metropolitan areas. It
begins by identifying a set of centers in each metro, then we use segregation/spatial concentration
statistics to characterize each center.


## Setup

1. clone this repository
2. run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to build the conda environment with necessary dependencies
   - run `conda activate pbpl204` each time you work on the project


## Running the Analysis:

The analysis is executed entirely through Jupyter notebooks stored in the `notebooks` folder.
The notebooks do the following and should be executed in this sequence:

1. first_notebook.ipynb
   this notebook identifies employment centers in SD....

2. second_notebook.ipynb

## Results:

After running all the notebooks, we're left with a set of polygons that define regional employment centers in both Rside and SD. notebook_xyz has interactive maps displaying these centers

### San Diego

We find xxx employment centers in SD. They are located in.....

they contain a total of XXXX employees

### Riverside

## Next Steps

1. first
